# RLang-Language
RLang Language is a interpreted language.<br>
RLang is a simple procedural language run on a interpreter.<br>
But in future Object oriented programming feature might be added<br>
Syntax of RLang if influenced by C++<br>
i.e variable declaration int a ;<br>

But RLang focuses on :<br>
Reducing complexity of syntax <br>
Enchancing Readability of code<br>

It supports below data types <br>
1.bool<br>
2.int<br>
3.float<br>
4.string <br>

syntax :<br>
printing to screen.<br>
print(data);<br>
print(data,modifier);<br>
Development :
Currently Interpreter is able to do Lexical Analysis.<br>
Parsing and interpreting and executing<br>
NOTE: PARSER AND INTERPRETER ARE NOT COMPLETE MEANING THEY DONOT MAKE ANY ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE THEY HAVE RIGID.
SYNTAX SO PARSER IS BEING MADE SEPARATELY ON OTHER REPOSITORY<br>
THOUGH INTERPRTER PART HAS MADE PROGRESS BUT IT IS TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENT FOR NOW<br>
Recursive descent parser is being planned to made<br>


The language doesnt hsve any intermediate representation like pythons bytecode to keep simplicity<br>
